1. [X] Create an empty array which can contain ten integers.

    - [X] - Fill that array with numbers 10, 20, …​, 100. (Hint: use loops)

    - [X] - Print only the elements of that array that are on odd indices (values 20, 40, …​).

    - [X] - Multiply elements on even indices by 5. Print the modified array.

2. [X] Re-do the Collatz conjecture exercise, but this time instead of printing each step, add it to a sequence.

    - [X] - Pick a starting number. Interesting choices, among others, are 9, 19, 25 and 27.

    - [X] - Create a sequence whose only member is that starting number

    - [X] - Using the same logic as before, keep adding elements to the sequence until you reach 1

    - [X] - Print the length of the sequence, and the sequence itself

3. [X] Find the number in a range from 2 to 100 which will produce the longest Collatz sequence.

    - [X] - For each number in the given range calculate its Collatz sequence

    - [X] - If the length of current sequence is longer than the previous record, save the current length and the starting number as a new record (you can use the tuple (longestLength, startingNumber) or two separate variables)

    - [X] - Print the starting number which gives the longest sequence, and its length
